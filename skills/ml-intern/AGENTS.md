# Agent Notes

## Local Dev Servers

- Frontend: from `frontend/`, run `npm ci` if dependencies are missing, then `npm run dev`.
- Backend: from `backend/`, run `uv run uvicorn main:app --host ::1 --port 7860`.
- Frontend URL: http://localhost:5173/
- Backend health check: `curl -g http://[::1]:7860/api`
- Frontend proxy health check: `curl http://localhost:5173/api`

Notes:

- Vite proxies `/api` and `/auth` to `http://localhost:7860`.
- If `127.0.0.1:7860` is already owned by another local process, binding the backend to `::1` lets the Vite proxy resolve `localhost` cleanly.
- Prefer `npm ci` over `npm install` for setup, since `npm install` may rewrite `frontend/package-lock.json` metadata depending on npm version.
- Production defaults to the Bedrock Claude model. For local development with a personal Anthropic key, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ML_INTERN_CLAUDE_MODEL_ID=anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` before starting the backend. Other models are selected through the app's model switcher.

## Development Checks

- Before every commit, run `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run ruff format --check .`.
- If formatting fails, run `uv run ruff format .`, then re-run the Ruff checks before committing.

## GitHub CLI

- For multiline PR descriptions, prefer `gh pr edit <number> --body-file <file>` over inline `--body` so shell quoting, `$` env-var names, backticks, and newlines are preserved correctly.

## GitHub PRs

- Open code changes as GitHub PRs first. Do not push code changes directly to the Hugging Face Space deployment branch or Space remote before the PR has been opened, reviewed, and merged, unless the user explicitly asks to bypass the PR flow.

## Hugging Face Space Deploys

- The Space remote is `space` and points to `https://huggingface.co/spaces/smolagents/ml-intern`.
- Deploy GitHub `main` to the Space from the local `space-main` branch by merging `origin/main` into `space-main` with a single merge commit, then pushing `space-main:main` to the `space` remote.
- Keep the Space-only README frontmatter on `space-main`; `.gitattributes` should contain `README.md merge=ours` and the local repo config should include `merge.ours.driver=true`.
- Local dev commonly uses a personal `HF_TOKEN`, but the deployed Space uses HF OAuth tokens. When adding Hub features, make sure the Space README `hf_oauth_scopes` frontmatter and the backend OAuth request in `backend/routes/auth.py` include the scopes required by the Hub APIs being called. A feature can work locally with a broad PAT and still fail in production with 403s if OAuth scopes are missing; after changing scopes, users may need to log out and log in again to receive a fresh token.
- Recommended deploy flow:

```bash
git pull --ff-only origin main
git switch space-main
git config merge.ours.driver true
git merge --no-ff origin/main -m "Deploy $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
  -m "Co-authored-by: OpenAI Codex <codex@openai.com>"
git push space space-main:main
git switch main
```
